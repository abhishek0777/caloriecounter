Starting in your 20s, your metabolism begins to slow down, according to the National Institutes of HealthOff Site Icon (NIH). In your 30s, your metabolism rate slows even more.

Metabolism slows about 5 percent every 10 years after age 40, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human ServicesOff Site Icon (HHS).

                      It is safe for adults to consume caffeine, as long as it is consumed in moderation, according to the Food and Drug AdministrationOff Site Icon (FDA).

To keep caffeine at safe levels in the body, doctors recommend limiting intake to no more than 200 mg per day, according to the FDA. Two 5-ounce cups of coffee contains about 200 mg of caffeine, for example.

Every person is different, however, so a lesser amount of caffeine might be a better fit for you. Also, people who are pregnant, breastfeeding and children should be even more cautious of the amount of caffeine they consume, according to the National Institutes of HealthOff Site Icon (NIH).

If you are consuming too much caffeine, try to cut back slowly because caffeine can cause withdrawal symptoms, including headache, tiredness and depression, according to the FDA.

Talk to your doctor for more information about caffeine safety.

                        Fortunately for people facing arthritis, choosing to follow an arthritis-friendly diet can help, according to the Arthritis FoundationOff Site Icon (AF).

If you have arthritis, avoiding processed foods and saturated fats can help the pain, according to the AF. Instead choose fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, whole grains, and beans. Having these foods in your diet can help your arthritis, according to the AF, by:

Beans – These are full of fiber and phytonutrients, which help lower C-reactive protein (CRP) – an indicator of inflammation found in the blood
Fish – This is a good source of inflammation-fighting omega-3 fatty acids
Fruits and vegetables – Both are loaded with antioxidants, which act as a natural defense system for the body
Nuts – Nuts, along with seeds, have been shown to help improve inflammation
Whole grains – These contain fiber, which can help maintain a healthy weight

                          For someone to determine their goal for weight loss is mostly based upon what the individual wants to accomplish. Whether that person wants to get off their medications, prevent their self from going on medications, having more energy, that's the primary reason. We get too bogged down into worrying about weight as a number versus the quality of life someone has or the health problems people have. So looking at their goals, whether that's getting off their diabetic medications, getting off their blood pressure pills, spending more time with their family, or playing with their children, those are the goals we really look at for weight loss.

   
Premier Physician Network (PPN) physicians say deciding on your best individual weight loss goal depends on what you want to accomplish. 

Whether you’re hoping to reduce some medications, prevent taking medications, have more energy, or just feel better about yourself, your reason for weight loss will help determine your goal.

In general, striving to lose 5 percent to 10 percent of your weight at a time is a good goal. Once you meet this smaller goal, you can set another smaller goal and keep going until you reach your ultimate goal.

For more information about how to determine your goals for weight loss, talk to your doctor.

                        long-term success with weight loss is around looking at this as a lifestyle. Not necessarily a diet or a fad diet or all the fad diets you see on, every 6 months there's a new fad diet to try or a new thing everyone's looking at, and these are all ineffective ways to lose weight long term. So really you should look at this as not a diet or not something to try, as more of a good habits to get into. In our surgical and nonsurgical patient's book, we don't expect anyone to be perfect. People still have dessert and people still have food they enjoy, but on a day to day basis, they have to be eating much better, much more good days than bad days. And getting them to good habits, and long term with diet and exercise, that'll make them more successful long term.

  
If you’re looking to make your weight loss last a lifetime, focus on making lifestyle changes that you can stick with instead of jumping into a fad diet, Premier Physician Network (PPN) physicians say.

Instead of searching for a new diet or something new to try, focus on basic good habits: Eat better. Have more good days than bad ones. Make exercise part of your routine. 

Once you’ve made healthy choices part of your ongoing lifestyle, it will become easier to sustain long-term weight loss success.

                        Because the thyroid affects how fast or slow calories are burned, it in turn affects how much someone weighs, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Treating thyroid disease means helping to get thyroid hormone production back at a normal level, instead of excessively high or low, according to the NIH.

.

For example, treating an underactive thyroid will increase a person’s metabolism, which will help to burn more calories and cause weight loss, according to Premier HealthNet (PHN) physicians. Treating thyroid disease will also help prevent future weight gain.

                        Though there isn’t a specific treatment for lactose intolerance – because there isn’t a treatment to make the body create more lactase enzyme – there are steps you can take to manage lactose intolerance, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

                        Most people with lactose intolerance have different levels of how much lactose their body can tolerate, according to the FDA.
                        
                        For some people controlling the lactose in their diet could mean limiting the amounts of milk and other dairy products in their diets, according to the FDA. For other people, it could mean eliminating some things completely.
                        
                        Avoiding or greatly limiting milk in your diet can lead to a shortage of calcium, protein, riboflavin, and vitamin D, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
                        
                        If you are avoiding or limiting milk, you could eat foods with more calcium, such as leafy greens, shrimp, and broccoli, and drink orange juice fortified with calcium and vitamin D. Or, you could talk to your doctor about taking calcium supplements with added vitamin D, according to the NIH.

                        If you are vitamin D deficient, you can increase your vitamin levels with food, sunlight, and supplements, according to the National Institutes of HealthOff Site Icon.

Only a few foods have vitamin D naturally in them, but many foods in the U.S. are fortified with vitamin D.

Some foods that have vitamin D include milk, breakfast cereals, orange juice, salmon, tuna, and mushrooms.

On a sunny day where you have a lot of your skin directly exposed to the sun, it can be easy to get all the vitamin D you need. But, getting sun through a window, while wearing sunscreen, or while mostly covered in clothing will not provide your body with vitamin D.

Though it’s important to get vitamin D from sunlight, it’s also important to take care to protect your skin from too much sun exposure to reduce your risk of skin cancer.

Two types of vitamin D supplements are available. Talk to your doctor for more information about which one and how much is the right amount for you.

To learn more about how to treat vitamin D deficiency, talk with your doctor.

                        Like many addictions, food addiction has no permanent cure, and while it can be treated, treatment can be difficult, according to the Food Addiction InstituteOff Site Icon (FAI).

                        The difficulty and steps to treat food addiction can be different from person to person, depending on how far the addiction has progressed before the patient seeks treatment, according to the FAI.
                        
                        As opposed to a different kind of addiction – such as smoking – a person can’t choose to quit the addiction altogether, according to the FAI. Because food is needed to live, it can’t be eliminated from a person’s daily routine.

                        If you have arthritis, it is beneficial to seek the help of a doctor or a nutritionist, both to learn more about your specific condition and also to learn how your diet affects your arthritis, according to Premier HealthNet(PHN) physicians.

By talking to a physician, you can find out which type of arthritis you have – osteoarthritis, degenerative arthritis, or inflammatory arthritis, the PHN physicians say. This is important because the treatment is different for different kinds of arthritis.

Talking with a nutritionist can help you determine what foods to include in your diet to help decrease inflammation, according to PHN physicians. A nutritionist also can let you know which foods to try to avoid.

For more information about seeking help from a doctor or nutritionist about arthritis, talk with your physician.

                        A safe rate for losing weight is basically dependent upon each individual person. We focus mostly on their body mass index or BMI to determine how quickly someone or the expectation how someone should lose weight. With a medical weight loss or non surgical weight loss, typically one to two pounds a week is a healthy rate to lose weight. With surgical weight loss of course, the weight loss is more rapid, and especially initially after surgery, where it could be even up towards a pound a day once they get started.
                        Though a safe amount of weight to lose can be different for each of us, there are general guidelines that can help you meet your goals in a healthy way, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Typically, losing weight in a steady, gradual way can help you be successful. Losing 1 to 2 pounds per week is a healthy weight loss goal.

Talk to your doctor for more information about a safe rate to lose weight.

                        Lactase is able to break down the milk sugar into two simpler kinds of sugar that can be absorbed into the bloodstream, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

                        The thyroid is an essential hormonal gland that plays a major role in many of the body’s functions, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The thyroid’s function is to regulate the body’s metabolism, which affects how fast or slow things occur in the body, such as hair growth, heartbeat, and food excretion, according to Premier HealthNet (PHN) physicians.

The thyroid also controls how fast or slow you burn calories, which in turn affects your weight, according to the Office of Women’s Health[Link to http://womenshealth.gov/about-us/ in a new window with off site icon and 3rd party content disclaimer] (OWH), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

If a person’s thyroid gland is not in control, it can work in extremes, so it is important to try to keep its function in a midrange, according to PHN physicians.

                        The amount of hormone your thyroid makes affects your weight, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

                        If your thyroid is making too little of the hormone, you have a condition called hypothyroidism, which can cause weight gain, according to the NIH.
                        
                        If, however, your thyroid is making too much of the hormone, you have a condition called hyperthyroidism, which can cause weight loss, according to the NIH.
                        
                        These weight changes can be sudden, but typically they happen slowly over time, according to Premier HealthNet (PHN) physicians.

                        Weight loss medications are designed for people who have tried losing weight with diet and exercise alone and have found they need an extra boost, according to Premier HealthNet physicians.

Most weight loss medications can help people lose five to 10 pounds but won’t help them to continue losing weight unless they also continue with a diet and exercise routine, according to the National Institutes of HealthOff Site Icon (NIH).

                        Lactose intolerance is very common among adults, with about 30 million American adults being diagnosed with some level of lactose intolerance by age 20, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

                        Someone’s ethnic or racial background can make them more or less likely to become lactose intolerant. The condition is most common among people of Asian, African, or Native American descent and among Hispanics and Latinos, according to the NIH.
                        
                        People of European descent are least likely to be lactose intolerant, according to the NIH.
                        
                        Babies born prematurely sometimes also can have lactose intolerance, according to the NIH. The condition is hereditary, so most people inherit it from their parents, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
                        
                        Talk to your doctor for more information about who is at risk of developing lactose intolerance.

                        As people age, their hormones change, which causes their metabolic rate to change, according to Premier HealthNet (PHN) physicians.

As men lose testosterone and women lose estrogen, their metabolism slows, making the weight easier to put on and harder to take off.

Weight management can become more difficult for people in their 20s, but weight loss can become even trickier in your 30s, according to PHN physicians.

For more about why weight loss is more difficult as you get older, talk with your doctor.
