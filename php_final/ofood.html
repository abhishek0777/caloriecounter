<h1> How Many Calories Should I Eat a Day?</h1>
<p>Figuring out how many calories you should eat is one of life's greatest mysteries — or so it seems. Although calorie needs depend on many factors such as age, sex, and height, a general calorie range can help if you're looking to maintain or lose body weight.</p><br>
<h2>Let's Break Things Down</h2> <br>
<ul class="par">
	<li>The amount of calories your body requires each day is based on your basal metabolic rate, along with your level of physical activity. And what exactly is basal metabolic rate, or resting metabolism? Essentially, it's the energy your body requires to perform all the activities vital for life, like respiration and digestion.</li>
	<li>This rate accounts for about 70% of your total calorie needs, so it's pretty important to make sure you're fueling your body properly. The younger and taller you are, the higher your basal metabolic rate. Men also tend to have a higher resting metabolism than women.</li>
	<li>When it comes to the remaining 30% of your daily caloric expenditure, it mostly comes down to your level of physical activity, which can vary from day to day. Basically, the more active you are, the higher your energy needs.
</li>
</ul><br>
<h2>Eating the Recommended Amount of Calories</h2><br>
<p>We asked America's top nutrition experts to weigh in to cut through the most common calorie misconceptions and help you identify what you really need each day.

"Many people think eating fewer calories is better when trying to lose weight," says Felicia Stoler, DCN, MS, RD, FACSM, author of Living Skinny in Fat Genes. "However, unless you're a woman under 5-foot-3, I wouldn't recommend eating less than 1,600 calories per day."<br>

As Stoler points out, consuming too few calories can lead to a deficiency of essential nutrients and may even suppress the immune system.<br>
On the other hand, too many calories aren't ideal, either. In addition to weight gain and an increase in fat storage, consuming more calories than your body needs can result in a variety of less than pleasant ailments.
